/*Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either
 adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers can be produced.
 How would you write a function that,given a number, tries to find a sequence of
 such additions and multiplications that produce that number?
 For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.
