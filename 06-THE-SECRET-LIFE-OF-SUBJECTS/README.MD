# Object-oriented programming provides a bunch of ideas about how objects can be used to help manage the complexity of programs.

#The core idea in object-oriented programming is to divide programs into smaller pieces, and make each piece responsible for managing its own state.

#Different pieces of such a program interact with each other through interfaces, which are limited sets of functions or bindings that provide useful functionality at a more abstract level, hiding its precise implementaion

#Such program pieces are typically modeled using objects.

#Separating interface from implementation is a great idea. It is usually called encapsulation.
